# global500companies
I found the dataset on Kaggle. The tasks were created by ChatGPT. I specified the number of rows, the name of the columns and asked ChatGPT to create me some tasks to solve using SQL. Using MySQL I preformed query analysis about 500 global companies. I then created a presentation on Google Slides about the queries.
